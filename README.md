# Hi, I'm Rod 👋  

## About Me 

I am FrontEnd developer based in Oslo (originally from Spain, lived in London for 7 years) I love building beautiful and functional web applications and letting my creativity shine through code. I'm a natural problem-solver and self-learner. I am also a passionate and professional digital content creator with extensive experience in video creation, video editing and live streaming. I have started my own YouTube (35k+) and Twitch channel (10k+) from 0 and have built a solid follower base and engaged community and do live streams when the time allows it. This has allowed me to expand my skills in other fields like SEO copywriting, picture editing and public speaking amongst other things.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy...  
🎶 *playing music*  
🍺 *craft beer*   
🥋 *bjj*  
🎮 *video games*
